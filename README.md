Filmoteca is a small web app that lets you search movies and TV shows using the OMDb API.  
You can type a title, browse results with pagination, and click a card to see full details like year, genre, and plot.

- Modal with detailed info (poster, rating, plot, etc.)
- Custom CSS theme

## Tech Stack

- HTML

- JavaScript (ES Modules)

## Notes

- The app uses the free OMDb API, so sometimes not all movies or details will load.
- Missing posters will show a placeholder image.
- API requests may be slow at times.
